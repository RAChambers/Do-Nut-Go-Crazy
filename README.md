# Do-nut Go Crazy Game

###### A tribute to [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/)

# Welcome to Fred the Baker Baking Company!

I have the the pleasure of being contracted by Fred the Baker Baking Company to take a concept, Donut Maker Clicker, from the drawing board to the browser. 

Fred the Baker is tired of making real donuts and is ready to retire. He needed my help to keep his love of donuts alive. He wanted me to create a game that uses button clicks to create virtual donuts for the entire world to enjoy. But all those early mornings of donut making may have tired out his brain because he has some strange requirements for 'Auto Clickers' and 'Donut Multipliers'. The following requirements were requested:

# Donut Count
The number of Donuts you have created by clicking, either manually or with an Auto Clicker.

# Auto Clicker
Auto Clickers will automatically click for us every second after 10 donuts are clicked, so we don't have to continue to click manually.

# Auto Clicker Count
The number of Auto Clickers purchased. Auto Clickers apply one click per second for every Auto Clicker purchased.

# Auto Clicker Cost
The cost(number) of donuts required to purchase an Auto Clicker starts at 10 donuts. For each Auto Clicker purchased, the cost of the next Auto Clicker increases by 10%.

# Donut Multiplier
Donut Multipliers increase the value of each click by 20%.   Donut Multipliers increase the value of both manual and Auto Clicks.

# Donut Multiplier Count
The cost(number) of donuts required to purchase a Donut Multiplier starts at 20 donuts and ncrease the value of each click by 20% for each Donut Multiplier purchased.

# Also...
I needed to create a Header section which contains a navigation menu that when clicked will expand sections about:

# Fred the Baker Baking Company
# The inspiration for this game, Cookie Clicker
# My contact info

# Remarks

Needless to say, this was a fun project.  Enjoy!
